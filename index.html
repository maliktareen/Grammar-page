	<h1>What are parts of speech?</h1>
	<p>
Parts of speech are the categories into which words are classified based on their functions in a sentence. They are the fundamental building blocks of grammar, grouping words into categories based on their roles and how they function within a sentence.

These categories help us understand how words relate to each other and contribute to the overall meaning of a sentence.</p>
